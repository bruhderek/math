# fucking around with lunar client and stuff
Meth client is an injection client for Lunar client on macOS aarch64. This is a work in progress and there is still no release version. Feel free to use this code,
but keep in mind that it won't work by itself and many features are incomplete.
## Some features are:
1. Can inject some basic mods into the game (deobfuscate it first with BON and if it has a dependency you can add it to classpath)
2. Hack class patcher for reach hacks and stuff
3. Can execute java code inside the game (lunar client classes are deobfuscated by default)
## Note
I couldn't get imgui working cuz it always crashed
